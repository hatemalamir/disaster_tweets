# Disaster Tweets

Disaster Tweets is a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started). "In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t".

Sentament classification is a very basic task in NLP, but instead of using an off-the-shelf pretrained model, we took the chance to implement all the components from scratch with a low-level language (c++) to gain better understading of the inner working of common architectures used in NLP tasks.

I used the implementation in the wonderful book [Hands-On Machine Learning with C++](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-machine-learning-with-c/9781789955330) as a starting point. I fixed references to obsolete parts of PyTorch C++ API.
